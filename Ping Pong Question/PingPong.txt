Gonna take a break from the coding problems and answer this thing.  

So, "How many ping pong balls would it take to fill a 747 airplane?" So I guess the first step would be to measure the 
dimensions of the plane as well as the dimensions of a ping pong ball.  

1) Measurement of ping pong ball:	
	The standard diameter of a ping pong ball is 40mm, or 0.04m (Science has caused me to only rely on the metric system). 
	So the volume of the ball ((4/3)pi(r)^3), where r is the radius, would be about 3.35m * 10^-5.  Great.

2) Measurement of Boeing 747-400F (I figure we're trying to smuggle the most ping pong balls so I went for the 400F which 
is designed to carry goods and not passengers)
	Found this pdf file: http://www.cargolux.com/ftp/press/Brochures/pdfs/Boeing_747-400F.pdf. The website looks pretty 
	legit, so I'll trust it.  According to this, the total capacity for carrying goods is about 765.5m^3. 

3) Keep in mind that there's probably more room for ping pong balls than allowed by the volumes on that site.  This is 
probably because a freight plane has its storage volume measured by storage boxes, so there's probably a good 1/4 of the space occupied by 
open air if the ping pong balls were placed on their own without the boxes.  I'll give a rough estimate to about 1000m^3.  The question doesn't really mention whether or not the plane has to fly, so I'm packing it full.  

4) I don't know much about sphere packing and finding the most efficient way to pack ping pong balls, but hey, at least I 
know that sphere packing exists right?

5) -drum roll- by dividing 1000m^3 by .0000335m^3, you would gettttttttttt.....about 30 million ping pong balls (my answer 
was actually 29,850,746.2.)
