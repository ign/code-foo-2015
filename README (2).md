Question 2:
First I would take the dimensions of the plane which are 747-400 is 1035 cubic meters then I would take the balls dimensions which is .04m. The next thing you would do is take the 1035 and divide that by 4/3pie (.02)^2 times that by pie divided by rational 18 which gets you about 23,000,000 but then you should subtract a couple thousand from that to account for the equipment, seats ect. So for my final answer I would say that the best case scenario you can hold 22.5 million balls.  

Question 3:
took a bit of time but was very enjoyable to create

question 4:
not that hard of a question got a little confused at first but i was able to figure it out fairly quickly

question 5: 
i failed to complete this question unfortunitly im hoping this wont disqulify me from the program

bonus 
I decided to follow a tutoral with this and really delve into javaFX this again was very fun to create but i wasnt able to create the salvo part correctly but the main game works great
